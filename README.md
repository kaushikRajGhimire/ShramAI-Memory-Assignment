## Promise to myself in this project: 
# Use ChatGPT only when I cannot solve the error after 20 minutes of debug and Google.

## Day -1 Planning of the Project

How can I build this project? What are the requirements? How can it be done? What tech stack should I know? What all databases should I use? What all APIs do I need to create?

Initial Plan:

Monday->Planning and Requirements gathering
Tuesday->Tech Stack Finalization and what all I have to learn and where do I need to buy something
Wednesday->Start to code
Thursday->Code all the major modules
Friday->Code remaining modules
Saturday->Refine and optimise the code
Sunday->Submit the code with detailed documentation of the project
        Documentation should be API documentation and Architecture Documentation both.


Monday learnings and Implementation: 

1. Langchain and Langgraph documentation of Memory.
